### AI Assignemnts ###

This repository represents assignments done in class during the course "Applied Artificial Intelligence" with Prof. Jacek Malec.
Hence, you will find the topics below :

    A1. _Othello Project_ : Implement a full reversi game
    A2. _Probabilistic Reasoning over time_ : work with robot localisation based on forward filtering with a Hidden Markov Model.
    A3. _Machine Learning_ : use of the gradient descent to implement the linear regression and perceptron algorithms.
